    <h2>The Phantomic daughter</h2>
    <p>A phantomic daughter is not real. She exists only in the imagination of her father.</p>
    <p>Her own thoughts disturb.</p>
    <p>Her bounderies are violated.</p>
    <p>Her autonomy is considered betrajal.</p>
<p></p>
    <p>This is not love, this is psychological control.</p>

    <h2>A Quiet Form of Violence</h2>
    <p>It always felt like being on the outside rather than on the inside.Many challenges, but in truth very few helpful guidelines
       to counter externally imposed tasks with adequate approaches to solutions,</p>
     <p>  in order to make the best possible outcome of the situation.</p>

     <p>It felt like a mind, a way of thinking,that resembled an aquarium in the shape of a highly restrictive glass sphere.
        Nothing moved.It was a felt inner idling,within a constantly changing world,from which there seemed to be no escape.</p>

     <p>Something fit less and less with what seemed to be required to overcome this nightmarish feeling of being unable to make progress while trying to    flee.</p>

     <p>An eternal swimming in circles,without finding an exit from one’s own constricting structure of thoughts and lived repetitions that revolved     endlessly around themselves.</p>

      <p>And although all of this took place within my own head,although I — I and my body — belonged to myself,and thus did not seem entirely alienated     from the world as a whole,it did not feel like my life.</p>

     <p>And as would later become apparent,I was in fact not living my own life,but rather inside a manipulated, constructed matrix of a life,
            created by a person who pursued only one purpose to fabricate the illusion of a family and a life</p>
      <p>that they themselves were never capable of living.</p>

         Realistically, from my position, one assumes the real existence of a normal father figure.But this was different.</p>
      <p>This entity, with all of its personal inadequacies,created a construct that might be called a family in a social context,
          but in the end was nothing more than a puppet theater.</p>

      <p>A puller of strings, attempting to reshape family members into marionettes for their own purposes.Family members as personal forced laborers.
         Individuals as instruments to do what this thing was never capable of doing itself.</p>

      <p>One could also say: family members as camouflage before the world, shielding a deeply disturbing personal worldview and profound social     	incompetence.</p>

    <h2 class="doto-subtitle">001 – First Entry 31.01.2026</h2>
    <p>I am moving further and further away from what I believed for a long time - or rather, from what I was made to believe - that he was my father.</p>
    <p>Over the years in which it became clear to me that something was wrong, this feeling has grown stronger rather than weaker is troubling.</p> 
<p>He has such a strange intrusive manner, unlike anything I would normally describe as a father. It feels more like a person who believes they have a right to control the views and
ways of the lifes of their famely members</p>
<p>This man is concerning. Apparently, one must not grant him evena single centimeter of one's own living space</p> 
<p>I have the feeling he has nothing better to do than to drag everything around him down into the abyss</p>
<p>I must wait. There is nothing else I can do at the moment.</p>
<p>We will see what happens tomorrow. But if I allow myself to trust my feelings - which I absolutely should - then because of him.</p>
<p>I am in nothing but the greatest danger.</p>

    <h2 class="doto-subtitle">002 – Second Entry 01.02.2026</h2>
    <p>The indirect and direct provocations and physical assaults are increasing again. A month has passed.</p>
    <p>One month since New Year’s Eve 2025, on which he senselessly vented all of his frustration and sadism on me.</p>

    <p>On New Year’s Eve, he wanted to punish me for living my life — in contrast to him, who no longer has a life of his own — through the usual pointless    	police actions.</p>

     <p>Hatred toward one’s own child can, of course, also be expressed in this way having them locked up in police custody for no reason.</p>

    <p>Just as he tried during the summer, for his own satisfaction and by his own admission to me, to provoke me in such a way that I would end up in a    	psychiatric institution.</p>

    <p>This man is becoming increasingly dangerous to me, both psychologically and physically.</p>

    <p>By now, I am warning the police. At the first signs that he is once again losing control of his frustration and then venting it on me in his sadistic   	manner.</p>

    <p>And all of this only because he once again made a wrong decision.</p>

    <p>I said no. No caregiving responsibility. No legal guardianship in his hands.</p>

    <p>So here we are. In this house, I can only feel reasonably safe from him with my room door locked.</p>

     <p>He is becoming more and more dangerous to me. As he has throughout my entire life, he has made it his goal to destroy me.</p>

     <p>Abortion was still illegal in 1972.So he chooses this path instead.</p> 

  <p><span class="time">14:35</span></p>
  <p>The situation is becoming increasingly oppressive. I basically have no enemies, but somehow this man seems unaware of his tone and   actions. I prefer isolation. What does “Abschottung” mean? Critical distance.</p>
