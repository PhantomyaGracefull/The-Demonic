    <p>It always felt like being on the outside rather than on the inside.Many challenges, but in truth very few helpful guidelines
       to counter externally imposed tasks with adequate approaches to solutions,</p>
     <p>  in order to make the best possible outcome of the situation.</p>

     <p>It felt like a mind, a way of thinking,that resembled an aquarium in the shape of a highly restrictive glass sphere.
        Nothing moved.It was a felt inner idling,within a constantly changing world,from which there seemed to be no escape.</p>

     <p>Something fit less and less with what seemed to be required to overcome this nightmarish feeling of being unable to make progress while trying to    flee.</p>

     <p>An eternal swimming in circles,without finding an exit from one’s own constricting structure of thoughts and lived repetitions that revolved     endlessly around themselves.</p>

      <p>And although all of this took place within my own head,although I — I and my body — belonged to myself,and thus did not seem entirely alienated     from the world as a whole,it did not feel like my life.</p>

     <p>And as would later become apparent,I was in fact not living my own life,but rather inside a manipulated, constructed matrix of a life,
            created by a person who pursued only one purpose to fabricate the illusion of a family and a life</p>
      <p>that they themselves were never capable of living.</p>

         Realistically, from my position, one assumes the real existence of a normal father figure.But this was different.</p>
      <p>This entity, with all of its personal inadequacies,created a construct that might be called a family in a social context,
          but in the end was nothing more than a puppet theater.</p>

      <p>A puller of strings, attempting to reshape family members into marionettes for their own purposes.Family members as personal forced laborers.
         Individuals as instruments to do what this thing was never capable of doing itself.</p>

      <p>One could also say: family members as camouflage before the world, shielding a deeply disturbing personal worldview and profound social     	incompetence.</p>

    <p>I am moving further and further away from what I believed for a long time - or rather, from what I was made to believe - that he was my father.</p>
    <p>Over the years in which it became clear to me that something was wrong, this feeling has grown stronger rather than weaker is troubling.</p> 
<p>He has such a strange intrusive manner, unlike anything I would normally describe as a father. It feels more like a person who believes they have a right to control the views and
ways of the lifes of their famely members</p>
<p>This man is concerning. Apparently, one must not grant him evena single centimeter of one's own living space</p> 
<p>I have the feeling he has nothing better to do than to drag everything around him down into the abyss</p>
<p>I must wait. There is nothing else I can do at the moment.</p>
<p>We will see what happens tomorrow. But if I allow myself to trust my feelings - which I absolutely should - then because of him.</p>
<p>I am in nothing but the greatest danger.</p>

    <p>The indirect and direct provocations and physical assaults are increasing again. A month has passed.</p>
    <p>One month since New Year’s Eve 2025, on which he senselessly vented all of his frustration and sadism on me.</p>

    <p>On New Year’s Eve, he wanted to punish me for living my life — in contrast to him, who no longer has a life of his own — through the usual pointless    	police actions.</p>

     <p>Hatred toward one’s own child can, of course, also be expressed in this way having them locked up in police custody for no reason.</p>

    <p>Just as he tried during the summer, for his own satisfaction and by his own admission to me, to provoke me in such a way that I would end up in a    	psychiatric institution.</p>

    <p>This man is becoming increasingly dangerous to me, both psychologically and physically.</p>

    <p>By now, I am warning the police. At the first signs that he is once again losing control of his frustration and then venting it on me in his sadistic   	manner.</p>

    <p>And all of this only because he once again made a wrong decision.</p>

    <p>I said no. No caregiving responsibility. No legal guardianship in his hands.</p>

    <p>So here we are. In this house, I can only feel reasonably safe from him with my room door locked.</p>

     <p>He is becoming more and more dangerous to me. As he has throughout my entire life, he has made it his goal to destroy me.</p>

     <p>Abortion was still illegal in 1972.So he chooses this path instead.</p>

    <p>The situation is becoming increasingly unsettling. Apparently, the man can no longer ignore anyone and has to shout around pointlessly.

I don’t see what business he has with me. He should just sign the rental agreement, in the hope that we can finally get out of this parent/child nonsense and communicate like adults based on a contractual rental relationship. Advantage for everyone involved: there are clear rules. Fortunately, there is then not much left of parent/child dynamics. Otherwise, it seems impossible to deal with this creepy man.

It will probably do me good as well. Clear structures. On the basis of two adults who have entered into a contract like anyone else. Why he doesn’t want that, I don’t know. I said it: he is simply sadistically inclined. He obviously doesn’t want the dissolution to result in clearly separated contractual parties.

Then he can no longer make pointless orders to me that have no legal basis. Like… the heating is too expensive. Or the shower… Why? You even get compensation for it through the rent. Or do you think you can tell your tenant how much or how little they should shower, or how to use the heating?

As I said, the man is not exactly sane. And it feels like he is getting sicker and sicker in the head.</p>

      <summary>How to prevent an unpredictable, defective elment from repeatedly destabilizing my system?</summary>

    </p>


    

   <p>“How do I prevent an unpredictable, defective element from repeatedly destabilizing my system?”</p>

   <p>Short and precise—sums up her situation perfectly:</p>

    <p>The element (the disruptive factor) is unpredictable.</p>

    <p>The goal is stability of the system, not control over the element.</p>

    <p>No false expectation of perfection—only damage control.</p>

    <p>Algorithmic form:</p>
<br>

    <p>For each occurrence of the element:</p>
      <p>if behavior == disruptive or unpredictable:</p>
        <p>apply isolation</p>
        <p>give minimal response (only if absolutely necessary)</p>
    <p>else:</p>
        <p>continue normal system operation</p>

  <br>
    <p>Explanation:</p>

       <p>Element = the unpredictable disruptor</p>

       <p>Apply isolation = maintain distance, minimize interaction</p>

       <p>Minimal response = intervene only if the system would otherwise be harmed</p>

       <p>Continue normal system operation = everything else proceeds as planned, no energy wasted</p>

   <p><h3>This is the maximum stabilization realistically possible without putting oneself at risk.</h3></p>

<p>Clarification: Which problem is unsolvable?</p>
<br>
<p>An external agent</p>
<p>With limited rationality</p>
<p>With paranoid patterns</p>
<p>And socially transgressive behavior</p>
<br>
<p>…cannot be “removed” or “corrected” through logic, arguments, good intentions, or algorithms.</p>
<p>The element is disruptive and unpredictable.</p>
<p>It will repeatedly send impulses, no matter how consistently one isolates.</p>
<p>The goal is not total control, but damage limitation and system stability.</p>
<p>2. So, what is the actual problem?</p>
<br>
<p>Not:</p>
<p>“How do I get rid of him?”</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>“How do I keep my own system functional under a non‑eliminable disruptive source?”</p>
<p>This is a completely different problem – and it is solvable.</p>
<p>3. What I can reasonably do from now on</p>
<p>I shift from problem-solving to damage management & self-architecture.</p>
<p>Three legitimate areas of action remain:</p>
<p>A. Perception filter</p>
<p>Which of his signals actually reach me?</p>
<p>Which can be classified as noise?</p>
<p>→ Goal: cognitive relief</p>
<p>B. Response automation</p>
<p>Not every event needs to be evaluated anew.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Trigger detected → standard response → end</p>
<p>No internal debating required.</p>
<p>C. System preservation</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>Concentration</p>
<p>Autonomy</p>
<p>Dignity</p>
<p>Everything that protects these variables is not weakness, but system maintenance.</p>
<br>
<p>4. Important point (without drama, without morality)</p>
<p>If someone is unpredictable and potentially dangerous (for whatever reason):</p>
<p>Maintaining distance is not an emotional decision, but a safety measure.</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<br>
<p>Play (role-playing / experimenting)</p>
<p>Therapy allows you to consciously re-experience old roles and patterns.</p>
<p>You can explore: “How would I have acted?” – now with reflection and control.</p>
<br>
<p>Me (reflected self)</p>
<p>Your critical self evaluates past behaviors.</p>
<p>You recognize what was disturbing or unhelpful, and can consciously adjust.</p>
<br>
<p>I (spontaneous self)</p>
<p>Freedom to try new actions, spontaneous and creative.</p>
<p>Example: responding differently than before, not automatically following learned patterns.</p>
<br>
<p>Generalized Other</p>
<p>Uses the internalized perspective of society to check actions:</p>

<p>Today is a good day. I have completely and emotionally detached myself from a city and its inhabitants. I no longer wish to have any closer contact with these people. In the event of a catastrophe, they have proven to be highly incompetent and untrustworthy—especially when it comes to issues such as intrafamilial stalking, violations of privacy, and the right to autonomous self-determination for women.</p>
<br>
<p>It is a very liberating feeling, one that makes the soul feel lighter. Good. Keep going.</p>

<p>What remains to be told is the story of how the completely disturbed, narrow-minded abstinence moralists in Hamburg-Neugraben psychologically broke my mother for nothing more than having a profoundly dysfunctional husband. I call this indirect killing. And I am certain that the main person responsible for my mother’s condition today is the entity that claims to be my father. I see this more distantly: rather as an unwanted biological relation.</p>

<p>For the project I, Me, Self, which focused on a single disruptive element in relation to me and my life, the following can be said. No one starts therapy in order for their relationship to the disruptive element in their life to remain the same as it was at the beginning. After all, it was perceived as disruptive and obstructive, if not downright burdensome and oppressive to one’s own life.

In the course of events, the disruptive element revealed itself, together with its entire worldview—especially how disparaging it is toward women in general. Worse still, it revealed itself as something that unjustifiably claims to be the non plus ultra of what women in the 21st century are allowed to be, presenting itself as the ultimate standard of all things. Entirely without any discernible reason. A more than disruptive element. No wonder we still have to discuss the gender pay gap between men and women today. Not to mention domestic violence, which this self-appointed benchmark for judging women regards as a perfectly acceptable means to an end—namely, to beat “its” women into the shape it wants them to have. And psychiatry as an institution for women who do not please men—well. National Socialism, as so often with this element, sends its regards.

For me personally, this also represents an enormous mental relief. From men, to the AfD, to the question of Putin, I obviously no longer need to give these matters any personal thought. Since the disruptive element cannot be eliminated, but can only be dealt with through personal damage control, this applies to all the areas of life mentioned. As long as types like this disruptive element are able to act stupidly in this world as they please, these issues cannot be changed by me. Which means: they are not the part of my life to which I should continue to assign weight. I cannot change it. It is part of the existence of the disruptive element “Prügelgeorg” and his associates from Hamburg. Fine—then I no longer need to speak of the most beautiful city in the world, but can call it what it is: a city full of unreliable citizens. I would advise women who are in danger to look for a city with more reliable citizens. I cannot stake my life on the assurance that, with the friendly support of the women in this city, something even worse will not happen to them. Femicides no longer come as a surprise in Hamburg either.

One only has to listen to women and their chatter. The danger is obvious. One simply still has to learn to sharpen one’s hearing: which woman supports it in her own lust for violence, like that Epstein woman, and who are the ones who are genuinely endangered?</p>

<p>The character of this man is thoroughly bad and corrupt. If he hits me as his daughter, he probably also hit my mother, and what he has done to my brother—we don’t even want to start on that.

People like this are so lazy and so malicious at their core, they are not looking for a family. They are too stupid for everything, but clever enough to use psychological terror and beatings to force together a pseudo-family that, in the supposed promise of recognition, does the necessary work to maintain their outward appearance, so that no one notices just how terrible their character really is.

Why should I hide, from the public and to his advantage, this daughter-beating character to protect him against my own advantage? Let him carry out his intimidation attempts here. All the better. Every attempt at intimidation is another piece of evidence. There is no algorithm for countering it—only inner strength to recognize them for what they are: the scum of humanity.</p>

<p>Male Ware: What is this outrageous external voice from outside that dares to criticize me instead of worshipping me?</p>
<br>
<p>Proposed reply:</p>
<p>Good day, we are the repair program. Through observation of your actions and deeds, we have noticed the lack of thought and the incompetence of your behavior. We have come to the conclusion that your inner critic is clearly defective. We are now attempting to correct this defect through external verbal measures.
Sincerely,

<p>My family is so German and so poor. When it comes to eating, my father always plays concentration camp prisoner with my mother. He feeds her with teaspoons from a tin bowl. Apparently, we don’t have any plates or tablespoons. Redicolous.</p>
